# Python, now with 39% more GUI üêçüíª

Template for pythons apps with a GUI. Features automated builds on release with binaries for Windows, MacOS and Linux users to download.
Contains linting, formatting and testing tools.

Although this template is meant to be a base for bigger projects, there are some limitations and annoyances that derive from using python bindings with Qt. To name a few, testing can be cumbersome with PyTest-Qt and the API is not always easy to work with or well documented. Other than that, there is also no tooling for using Qt translations with ease so this template essencially provides a non-localized app, this is not to say that it can't be added when building upon it.

With the exception of the points above, we believe this template to be decently production ready.

## Requirements üìã

- Python 3.12.0+

## Usage üöÄ

- Go to the `Releases` page of the GitHub repository.

- Under the `Assets` section for the latest release, click the entry with the name of your operating system.

- After downloading, extract the top content from the `.zip` to anywhere you want.

### Windows

- Run the `main.exe` file inside the extracted folder, you can create a shortcut with any name you like for this file.

### Linux

- Run the `main.bin` file inside the extracted folder. Note that compilation is targeted at Ubuntu (Wayland), other distributions may need additional actions to run the app.

### MacOS

- Run the bundle installer extracted from the `.zip` file.

## Development üõ†Ô∏è

- Clone the repository and open a terminal **inside** it.

- Install the dependencies:

  ```shell
  # It is it recommend that a virtual environment is set before doing this!

  pip install .
  ```

- Start the app:

  ```shell
  python src/main.py
  ```

## Tooling üß∞

- Ruff is used as a linter and formatter:

  ```shell
  pip install .[check]
  ruff check --fix
  ruff format

  # To automatically lint and format on every commit install the pre-commit hooks:
  pre-commit install

  # Note that when using pre-commit the git command will fail if any files are lint fixed or formatted.
  # You will have to add the changed files to the staged area and commit again to apply the changes.
  ```

- PyTest and PyTest-Qt are used for testing:

  ```shell
  pip install .[test]
  pytest
  ```

- Nuitka is used for cross-compiling to all supported platforms:

  ```shell
  pip install .[build]
  nuitka <options>
  ```

  See the build [workflow](./.github/workflows/build.yaml) for a list of options used for each platform.

## Notes üìù

When using this repository as a template make sure to:

- Edit the project name and version in the `pyproject.toml` file.

- Edit the constants that refer to the app in the `utils/constants.py` file.

- Make sure the string in the `version.py` file matches the project version in the `pyproject.toml` file. This is only needed for the initial setup, after that the `release.yaml` workflow will ensure they are always both incremented and kept in sync.

- Update most of the `ENV` variables in the `build.yaml` workflow for the final build manifest.
